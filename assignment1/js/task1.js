// Portoflio Assignment Task 1
/*Create a special calculator that read a number from the user, checks that it is an integer and performs a series of mathematical calculations as listed:
calculates the number's factorial. A factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g., the factorial of 4 is equal to 24 (4 * 3 * 2 * 1).
Calculate the square and cube of the number. A number squared is a number that is multiplied by itself; e.g., 22 is equal to 4 (2 * 2). A number cubed is a number that is multiplied by itself twice e.g., 23 is equal to 8 (2 * 2 * 2).
