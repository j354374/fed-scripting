## Website Audience

The audience is job seekers especially those for whom the income from a job would improve their standard of living. It site is to be used by people who are keen to work but are struggling with standard recruitment processes. The concept is that we flip recruitment so that workers are much more informed and empowered. We tell them where the work is and where the labour shortages are by data mining the information from publicly available sources such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The website also gives job seekers a listing of the core skills needed for a job to help them find the work they are suitable for.

## Social media integration

## beautifier
The following site was used to "clean" the html and css code to make it easier to read:
https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer/
however, it created an error of "undefined" at the top of the HTML file when attempting to clean index.html. I repeated this after running the validator and fixing any errors or warnings and the issue resisted.
